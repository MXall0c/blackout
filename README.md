# BLACKOUT
## Shut your filthy mouth internet

For use with pi-hole, pfhole, or other such contraptions.

The lists of lists were gotten from the firebog.net and the blocklist project. All told, it comprises nearly 50 seprately maintained blacklists spanning ads, malware, trackers, and whatever other BS happened to have annoyed the maintainer.

This script would be useless without the constant vigilance of all the maintainers out there, thank you.

*My* lists of lists were gotten from here:
- https://firebog.net/
- https://blocklist.site/app/index.php

I'm just scratching the surface, I'm sure.

## Make your own...
Use my master if you want, it'll probably break crap. I've mainly got this up so I can track it and have it in a handy accessable place.
